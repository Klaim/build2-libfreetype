See upstream/docs/INSTALL.ANY for generic build instructions.

Directory layout

We put the platform-specific sources in src/base/{unix,windows}/ instead of
builds/{unix,windows} as upstream does because they are planning to make this
change themselves (see
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/issues/1022).

ftoption.h (generated header)

Instead of generating freetype/config/ftoption.h we manually customized it
(see downstream/) because the only parts that are dynamic in the upstream
build relate to the dependencies which are static in our build.

Harfbuzz

There is a circular dependency between Freetype and Harfbuzz (see
upstream/docs/INSTALL.UNIX, section "3.1 Interdependency with HarfBuzz").
Freetype's dependency on Harfbuzz is the weaker one so breaking the cycle here
makes sense and this is also what Debian and vcpkg do.

LCD subpixel rendering: ClearType vs. Harmony

Freetype provides two alternative subpixel rendering technologies: the newer
Harmony (the default) and a ClearType-like one if
FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING is defined in ftoption.h.

Harmony produces output of the same quality as ClearType but was only added to
Freetype 2.8.1. Many OS distributions used to disable ClearType due to patent
issues but these patents have since expired. For ClearType to produce good
results the client has to set a filter otherwise it is likely to produce
severe color fringes. Harmony does not have this problem.

Debian Bullseye enables ClearType but as far as I can tell Harmony is the
preferred option going forward. Therefore we go with Harmony in this package.

See https://github.com/jgneff/openjdk-freetype/wiki/Screenshots for a
side-by-side comparison between Harmony and ClearType and
https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/60658#comment178017 and
https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-lcd_rendering.html for
information.
